## Installation

Install from FoundryVTT setup / Add-on modules / Install module with Manifest URl : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThroughlyDruxy/tor2e-npc-parser/main/module.json

## Description
This module allow for copy and pasting a statblock directly from the book to create a adversary character sheet.

1. Navigate to actor tab in the sidebar and at the bottle will be a new button called "Parse Statblock". Click that.
2. A textbox will open. Copy directly from the PDF starting at the creatures name before the description and through till the final Fell ability.
3. Choose "Core Rules" or "Adversary Conversion.pdf" from the drop down based on where it was copied from.
4. Paste it into the textbox and hit Go.

This is currently in Alpha. It is somewhat tested and should work for all of the adversaries in the Core Rule Book. Be sure to start the copying from the name in big red letters (but not all caps) below the red line, then select to the end of Fell abilities. If nothing happens, hit F12 and check the log for errors. Please report any errors on this page in the issues section or DM me on discord at ThroughlyDruxy#4390.

## For Loremasters
Currently when an Orc is parsed, Hatred (subject) is added automatically. However not all orcs have this ability and it should be assessed if appropirate or wanted.
