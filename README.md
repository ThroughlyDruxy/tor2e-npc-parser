TOR2E - Unofficial compendium for The One Ring 2nd edition - english version


## Installation

Install from FoundryVTT setup / Add-on modules / Install module with Manifest URl : https://github.com/ThroughlyDruxy/tor2e-npc-parser/blob/main/module.json

## Description
This module allow for copy and pasting a statblock directly from the book to create a adversary character sheet.

1. Navigate to actor tab in the sidebar and at the bottle will be a new button called "Parse Statblock". Click that.
2. A textbox will open. Copy directly from the PDF and paste into the text box.
3. Hit go and an NPC will be created.

This is currently in Alpha and my first project in JavaScript so please be patient. It is somewhat tested and should work for all of the adversaries in the Core Rule Book. Be sure to start the copying from the name in big red letters (but not all caps) below the red line, then select to the end of Fell abilities. If nothing happens, hit F12 and check the log for errors. Please report any errors on this page in the issues section or DM me on discord at ThroughlyDruxy#4390.

Currently it contains no user-facing error reporting but that will come soon.
